# maritime-kpi-monitoring-system

In the maritime industry, tracking performance accurately and on time is crucial for staying competitive. However, many small and medium-sized companies still rely on manual methods like Excel and disconnected software, causing delays and errors.
This project presents a web-based KPI monitoring system designed to centralize data input, automate calculations, and provide real-time visual insights. The system is easy to use, even for non-technical users, and supports key areas like logistics, maintenance, and supplier evaluation.
By improving data accuracy and speeding up decision-making, this system aims to help maritime companies operate more efficiently in a digital world.
